# YogiFi - Revolutionizing Yoga with Technology

YogiFi is a revolutionary app that seamlessly blends the wisdom of ancient Indian yoga with cutting-edge technology. Our project focuses on creating a holistic platform for users to embark on a journey of self-discovery and improvement through yoga practice.

## Technologies Used
- **Website Development**: React JS
- **AI Model**: MoveNet

## Project Overview
The project encompasses the development of a website, a mobile app, and integration with AI models for real-time pose estimation. Key features include guided yoga sessions, posture recognition, and personalized feedback for users.

## Data Collection
We collected 3D images and videos of various yoga poses to train our AI models. Continuous data collection and refinement are essential for improving the accuracy and robustness of our pose estimation algorithms.

## Learnings and Future Directions
Throughout the project, we encountered challenges in AI model training, mobile app development, and UI/UX design. However, we gained valuable insights into the complexities of integrating technology with yoga practice. Future enhancements may include expanding the pose library, implementing user profiles, and incorporating advanced analytics for personalized recommendations.
